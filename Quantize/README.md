# QUANTIZE!

A basic app to track manually entered data points for multiple tasks. 
Project built in Android Studio 4.0.1. 
Installation should be as easy as cloning this repo and importing into Android Studio.

## Usage
The initial screen allows you to:
- Create new data sets (add from floating action button in lower right)
- Rename, reorder and delete data sets (long press on name for edit)
- Jump into an individual data set

From an individual data set, you can see all data points for that set and enter in new ones!

## Limitations
The following were beyond the initial scope of this little app, but could be good targets for future work.
- Attach dates/times to data points
- Allow data sets to use different data types, rather than all using natural numbers
- Current business logic has all updates to the main list of data sets go through a Room db
    -- If performance issues manifest with large numbers of tasks, may need to revisit this
